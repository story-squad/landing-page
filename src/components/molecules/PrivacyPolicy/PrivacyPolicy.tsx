        <h2>Frequently Used Terms</h2>
        <p>
          At Story Squad, we believe it is important to use plain, clear

        <h2>Users</h2>

          anyone who accesses or uses the Story Squad app or site. Users may
          further be categorized into two groups, as follows:

        <p>

          anonymous information that is associated with a specific user (or that
          user&apos;s personal details) is also considered personal information
          for the purposes of this policy. This information should not be
          included in any fictional stories submitted onto the app.

        <h2>Anonymous Information</h2>

          U.S. federal regulation passed by U.S. Congress in 1998 and enforced
          by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Story Squad LLC operates in
          full compliance with COPPA. For more information on what the Act
          entails, please visit the{' '}

        <h2>Policy Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Story Squad is committed to protecting the privacy of anyone who
          accesses our site and our Clash of the Pencils app. This Privacy
          Policy explains the ways in which we collect information from users,
          what we do with that information, and how users may remove or modify
          their information. Story Squad follows this Privacy Policy in
          compliance with applicable law in the places where we operate. If
          necessary, Story Squad may provide additional privacy notices relevant
          to specific situations; those notices are to be read and considered in
          conjunction with this policy. The information that you provide to us
          via a third-party platform (for example, your web browser or mobile
          device) may be collected separately by those third-party platforms.
          The information that Story Squad collects is covered by this Privacy
          Policy. Privacy choices that you have made with other entities are not
          related to our Privacy Policy. We can not control and are not
          responsible for the privacy practices of entities we do not own.
        </p>
        <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Story Squad requires and collects from users only that information
          which is necessary to fulfill the functions of our site and app. This
          information falls into two categories: Information Users Provide to Us
          and Information We Collect from Users. In addition, we may combine
          these two types of information to create Aggregate Information, as
          defined in the frequently used terms above.
        </p>
        <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
        <p>
          We ask Users for personal information about themselves to provide our
          services. This information includes the user&apos;s first and last
          name, email address, password, as well as the user’s age, display name
          (“codename”), and site preferences.
        </p>
        <h2>Information Children Provide</h2>
        <p>
          Story Squad’s app Clash of the Pencils features activities that rely
          on child-generated content, including handwritten stories. These
          activities allow children to submit their own creative content. All
          creative work is understood by all parties to be fictional in nature,
          have text with zero implied sub-text, and not a factual account of any
          real-world experience. Creation of a child account will be considered
          &apos;high-level consent&apos; for the above outlined activities in
          accordance with C.O.P.P.A. In the case that we become aware of
          information collected from a child outside of that outlined in our
          Privacy Policy, we will either (a) immediately delete the information
          or (b) immediately seek high-level consent from the parental email in
          relation to the collected information.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We may automatically collect certain information from the computers or
          mobile devices of users, such as type of operating system, IP address,
          web browser, information about the websites that users visit from and
          go to after visiting Story Squad, links clicked and pages viewed
          within the site or app, interactions with e-mail messages we send, ISP
          info, and other standard server log information. We may use tracking
          technologies like tokens, software development tools, and program
          interfaces to collect this information automatically.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Story Squad uses your information only to provide and improve on our
          services to you and to comply with any applicable laws. In order to do
          this, we may use your information to (a) provide our service to you,
          (b) communicate with you about your account details and transactions
          or to request feedback, (c) personalize your experience, (d) use
          analytical tools to better understand and optimize ourservice, (e)
          detect, investigate, and prevent illegal activities or policy
          violations, and (f) to notify you of and obtain parental consent for
          children&apos;s activities. In addition, as a child-directed
          application, Story Squad vows to limit the collection and use of
          children&apos;s information to that which is reasonable and necessary
          in order for the children to participate in our activities. Should any
          user-generated content uploaded contain personally identifiable
          information outside of the scope of pre-existing parental consent, we
          reserve the right to delete it from our database.
        </p>
        <h2>When And How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>
          The information we share with others (and which entities we share it
          with) depends on the type of information. In most cases, information
          we collect is only used internally. Exceptions include child created
          content which is uploaded for publication as well as display names
          (“codename”) and age that exist on public-facing pages. We may also
          share information from users, both adult and child, to our service
          providers if the information is necessary for them to perform a
          business, professional, or technology support function. Story Squad
          LLC will disclose personal information in response to a court order or
          a subpoena, in compliance with U.S. law. In addition, we may disclose
          personal information of adults or children within the scope of all
          applicable laws, either in response to the requests of law enforcement
          or government agencies and/or if we believe the legal disclosure of
          such information may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate
          public safety, or protect the welfare of a child using our site or
          application. We also reserve the right to use personal information to
          protect the security and integrity of our site and app, and to take
          precautions against liability. Story Squad LLC will not share the
          information we collect with third parties for the purposes of
          advertisement or monetization outside of the program&apos;s stated
          services.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Options and Control of Information</h2>
        <p>
          As a parental user, you have a variety of options for controlling,
          updating, and deleting your information, as well as the information of
          your child. You may use the controls found across the site and app to
          update your information and set your preferences, and you may ask us
          to delete your account at any time. You may also request access to a
          record of all the personal information we store about you, and ask
          that we update or delete it. Likewise, parental users may at any time
          refuse or revoke permission for us to collect further personal
          information from your child, and can request that we delete your
          child&apos;s records from our database. This includes asking us to
          remove some or all of your child&apos;s created content. Please be
          aware that revoking permissions or deleting information may limit or
          terminate the ability of you or your child to participate in the
          service.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Story Squad LLC highly values the privacy, integrity, and security of
          your information. As such, we have implemented multiple layers of
          security designed to protect your information from unauthorized
          access, use, disclosure, and modification. While we regularly review
          and update our approaches to security and data management, it is
          important to be aware that no security measure is foolproof. In
          consideration of the inherent vulnerability of online data, Story
          Squad will only retain your information for as long as it is needed to
          fulfill the functions outlined in this Privacy Policy, or in
          accordance with applicable law.
        </p>
        <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>
          It may occasionally become necessary to update this policy in order to
          comply with new laws or regulations, or to accommodate new
          technologies or business practices. Should our Privacy Policy change,
          we will provide notice to you and, if necessary, require renewed
          consent as applicable in accordance with the law This notification may
          consist of an email to the address you furnished us with, or as a
          notification on our own platforms as best suits the circumstances or
          the policy changes themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>Contacting Us</h2>
